### Installation
Just download the zip file and open the app.

If you're using Spotify you'll be prompted to log into your Spotify account. It's not strictly necessary but it allows adding/removing favourites to your library. Thereâ€™s no server side logic, everything runs on your Mac.

### Usage
When you open Muse Bar you'll see a new button at the leftmost part of the control strip on your Touch Bar, displaying album art and playback action.

- Tap to play/pause.
- Flick left/right to go to the previous/next song.
- Long tap to show Muse Bar controls.

To quit Muse Bar, long tap the Muse Bar button on the control strip, then tap on the volume icon and tap Quit.

To launch Muse Bar at login, long tap the Muse Bar button on the control strip, then tap on the volume icon and tap Launch at Login.

Spotify, Apple Music and Vox are currently supported. The app automatically guesses the right player to control basing on availability and playback notifications.

### Build
Just clone the repository, install the pods and open the workspace file.
